;;Define composite
;; Composite takes an inner relation and an outer relation and returns a relation
;; For every (a b) tuple in the inner relation if b equals an A in a (A B) tuple in the outer relation
;; then add the duple (a B) to the relation you will be returning
;; order doesn't matter

;; Examples:
;; (composite '((2 4) (3 5) (4 6) (5 7)) '((1 2) (2 3) (3 4) (4 5)) ) -> '((1 4) (2 5) (3 6) (4 7))
;; (composite '((2 4) (5 8) (3 4)) '((2 4) (5 8) (3 4))) -> '()
;; (composite '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3)) '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3))) -> '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3))

;; Type Signature: (composite relation relation) -> relation
(define (nextRelation tuple relationInner)
  (if (null? relationInner)
      '()
      (if(equal? (cadar relationInner) (car tuple))
         (cons(list(caar relationInner)(cadr tuple))(nextRelation tuple(cdr relationInner)))
         (nextRelation tuple (cdr relationInner))
      )
  ))

(define (composite  relationOuter relationInner)
  (if (null? relationOuter)
      '()
      (append (nextRelation(car relationOuter) relationInner)(composite(cdr relationOuter) relationInner)
              )))

;; Define power
;; power takes a relation and applies composite to itself k times
;; You will need to use a helper to store the initial relation
;; when k is zero it should return '()
;; order doesn't matter

;; Examples:
;; (power '((1 2) (2 3) (3 4) (4 1)) 0) -> '()
;; (power '((1 2) (2 3) (3 4) (4 1)) 1) -> '((1 2) (2 3) (3 4) (4 1))
;; (power '((1 2) (2 3) (3 4) (4 1)) 2) -> '((1 3) (2 4) (3 1) (4 2))
;; (power '((1 2) (2 3) (3 4) (4 1)) 3) -> '((1 4) (2 1) (3 2) (4 3))

;; Type Signature: (power relation int) -> relation
(define (powerHelp relation newRelation k)
  (if (zero? k)
      '()
      (if (equal? k 1)
          newRelation
          (powerHelp relation (composite relation newRelation)(- k 1))
  )))
(define (power relation k)
  (powerHelp relation relation k))

;; Define transitive-closure
;; transitive-closure should compute the transitive-closure of a relation
;; Transitive-closure is the union of all possible powers of the relation
;; a helper will be needed to keep track of the current power
;; each (a b) tuple can only be used at most once in a path in power 
;; order doesn't matter

;; Examples:
;; (transitive-closure '((1 2) (2 3) (3 1))) -> '((1 1) (1 2) (1 3) (2 1) (2 2) (2 3) (3 1) (3 2) (3 3))
;; (transitive-closure '((1 3) (3 5) (2 4) (5 6) (2 3))) -> '((1 3) (3 5) (2 4) (5 6) (2 3) (1 5) (1 6) (3 6) (2 5) (2 6))

;; Type Signature: (transitive-closure relation) -> relation
(define (trans-closureHelper relation k)
  (if (zero? k)
      '()
      (union (power relation k)(trans-closureHelper relation (- k 1)))
  ))

(define (transitive-closure relation)
  (trans-closureHelper relation (length relation)))

;; Define transitive?
;; returns if a given relation is transitive

;; Examples:
;; (transitive? '((1 1) (1 2) (1 3) (2 1) (2 2) (2 3) (3 1) (3 2) (3 3))) -> #t
;; (transitive? '((1 2) (2 3) (3 1))) -> #f

;; Type Signature: (transitive? relation) -> boolean

(define (transitive? relation)
   (set-equal? (transitive-closure relation) relation) )

;; Define EQ-relation?
;; returns if a given relation is an EQ-relation
;; A relation is an EQ-relation if it is symmetric, reflexive, and transitive

;; Examples:
;; (EQ-relation? '((1 1) (1 2) (1 3) (2 1) (2 2) (2 3) (3 1) (3 2) (3 3)) 3) -> #t
;; (EQ-relation? '((1 1) (1 2) (2 1)) 2) -> #f
